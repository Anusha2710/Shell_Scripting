-- Lets execute the file now

- we can also execute by using "./" as (./my-first-shell-script.sh)

15. chmod command
- to enable this we need to enable permission
- using "chmod" (user, group, everyone)
                (4- read, 2- write, 1- execute)
                (eg- chmod 444 = we are giving read permission to user,group nd everyone)
- Now, we need to give all permissions in order to use ./
> chmod 777 my-first-shell-script.sh    ( which means 4+2+1=7)

16. Shell Script1:
- Now, lets write a shell script to create a folder, and 2 files inside the folder everytime when script is executed, we'll also change permissions of file.
> vi sample-shell-script.sh
![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/1037f673-8d42-45b3-afd8-679ed98bc718)

- lets give permissions now
> chmod 777 sample-shell-script.sh

17. Shell Script2:
- Now, lets write a shell script to check the Node Health of our VM.
> vi node-health.sh
1- set -x = command is used to debug bash script where every executed statement is printed to the shell for debugging.

- Lets execute the script

2- set -e = aborts the execution of a command and returns the exit status code of the command that failed.

- Lets execute the script

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/d953f99a-5aaa-4c14-88a1-31db74cf9262)

- But, when we add pipe statements

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/2bbc1cb1-6fe1-412d-aff1-740e6aa9c3d5)

- Then set -x does work, instead it executes the script without aborting the failed command i.e; it only considering last statements in script with pipe, it's just ignoring first statement

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/4be3e305-a09d-47d2-8d3d-34d059dcd2ff)

- To overcome with we are going to use "set -o pipeline" command

3- set -o pipeline

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/e3256f23-d82f-468a-89dd-02ee1905b3d7)

- Lets execute it aborts and throws error now.

18. Shell Script3:
- Now, Lets say in Amazon Company a developer has deployed 200 micro services, where each app uses different processes.

1- We need to find the processes running by "amazon" keyword 

> ps -ef | grep "amazon"
![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/9be821ac-1d06-4027-bf91-f90ad2532e12)

Here,  ps -ef = prints processes in full format,
       grep = filter the output with specific keyword,
       pipe = get output from first command and send it to second command

2- We need only process ids of "amazon" processes

> ps -f | grep "amazon" | awk -F" " '{print $2}'
![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/f7fd9594-7cdf-4ed8-bef6-2f4163e9d68b)

Here, awk = prints output in specific column (here we are printing data in 2nd column)

eg:
Lets create a test file now, try to print my name here

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/Shell_Scripting/assets/47424821/288f9a51-683b-49c6-90de-3bef482c6ead)

Lets try using GREP command, it prints the entire line

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/Shell_Scripting/assets/47424821/a29e246e-fd41-47d9-92ab-a373bf26739c)

 Lets try using GREP with AWK, now it gives only my name


19. DATE- Shell Script4 (Imp Interview Question):
- If we use date command, it prints todays date

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/2696acfe-0095-4fd2-bb9e-ff129485bc7b)

- But, if we use date command with echo, it prints only keywords present in echo, but not the actual command

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/AWS-Basics/assets/47424821/20c7341f-0b37-426a-a0c0-dbf08057b81c)
- Because, date is a system default command, it sends output to stdin, as pipe works only if it passes the info to next command but not stdio i.e: echo

20.

- In every company whenever an application is failing we go to log file and check the errors
- Lets upload the log files to external storage i.e; github
- Here, we use CURL command - retrieves the info from internet

![image](https://github.com/Anusha2710/Shell_Scripting/assets/47424821/427b10f1-c914-4029-942d-7312c816a663)
here we simply used curl along with grep command

- we can also use [curl -X GET api.(name)] to get the info from this api
